To use this application:

   type GIFTOOL -HELP to see all of the available option.

This utility will allow you to convert GIF images to and
from interlaced format, insert comments and remove comments.

The source for this application was taken from the Web site

   http://homepages.com/ (???)

All I have done to get the source to compile under IBM's
OS/2 C++ compiler is to modify the single reference of
"strcasecmp" to "strcmp" on line 1065 in the file "main.c".
